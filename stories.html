            <h2>Abby and Adams</h2>
            <img src="images/love1.jpg" alt="apicture of Abi and Adams">
            <p>The way we met was actually a happy accident. I had not changed my location settings or my age settings from the default,
                  so Matt kind of snuck in there, because there's a 13-year age difference and we lived 50 miles apart. So we got a match, but neither of us was really taking it seriously. Matt messaged me, and we talked a little bit, and just kind of got everything big, all of our baggage, out right away so we could see if it was even worth continuing to talk. I gave him my phone number and he texted me, "Hi, Hannah, it's Matt." And I said: "Which Matt?" as a joke.<br />
                  And that was it.<br /> 
                  We just talked nonstop from that point, and we went on our first date a week later. <br />
                  We went on a hike, and we put wine in water bottles and had a little picnic at the end of the hike.</p>
             <p>Neither of us was looking for anything super-serious, but we kept hanging out regularly and it just kind of happened without either of us noticing. I have a son from a previous relationship — Jackson, he was 2 at the time — and they met and just really hit it off. I knew from the first date that I really, really liked Matt. It was great, because I couldn't get out a lot at the time — <br />
                I could get out maybe once a week, if I had a babysitter. And you're not going to meet somebody at a bar if you're a single mom. So it saved me from meeting a lot of duds.</p>     
            <p>Five months into dating, he proposed, but we had already been talking about it for a few months. He had met my son, so we had to ask: Do we have a future? Is it worth dating and building a relationship with Jackson? We decided it was worth it, obviously. I'm grateful. I don't know what I did to deserve this, but I'm just going with it.</p>
                <h2>Cara and Jonah</h2>

            <img src="images/love2.jpeg" alt="a picture of cara and Jonah">
            <p>I signed up for online dating with a friend, almost like signing up for a marathon together. I went on dates with a few guys, and it wasn't good. I was just not into it, and was about to quit, but then I saw this guy. I'm 5-foot-10, and I've always had a thing about height, and I saw this guy with a really sweet, open face, and he was 6-foot-9, I was like, This can't be real.</p>
            <p>Somewhere on his profile, he'd said this his favorite book was The Great Gatsby. Not a big deal, not particularly revelatory. But I wrote back to him — and this is totally unromantic and kind of weird — this is my favorite sentence in Great Gatsby, and one of my favorite sentences ever, "If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, 
                as if he were related to one of the machines that registers earthquakes tens of thousands of miles away." And he responded and said that he actually 
                had a Great Gatsby sweatshirt.</p>
             <p>Two or three messages in, we found out that we live extremely close to each other, and he was like "Let's meet up." Somewhere in the conversation, and this was in December 2012, I told him I had just seen the film Les Miserables with my friends and hated it, and he was like, "I love Les Mis." I don't know why, but I trusted him, I gave him my address to pick me up, and I'd never done that before. 
                 I've always met at a neutral location. So when I got in the car, he had the Les Mis soundtrack playing, and I just remember thinking, OK, that's such a funny move. 
                 I'm so down with that.</p>   
            <h2>Julie and Ryan</h2>
            <img src="images/love3.jpeg" alt="a picture of julie and ryan">
            <p>Six months after moving to New York, I started online dating. Not necessarily because I really wanted for find a boyfriend; it was just me just wanting to go on dates because they were so much fun. There were points where I was going on dates with two or three people a week. Dating people casually, I didn't really meet anyone that I was interested in for a while. But I met a bunch of really interesting, 
                great guys, who I still keep in touch with — it's hard to be real friends with them, but we're pretty friendly. I've set up some of the guys on dates with my girlfriends.</p>
            <p>Eddy was the one who messaged me first, and initially I never got back to him. Then he was ready to quit online dating, and as a last-ditch effort he sent me a message, like, Hey, I'm getting off this, but I wanted to message you again and see if you would at all be interested in going on a date with me. 
                Send me a text if you're interested. And I actually texted him back, because I looked at his profile and saw that he was Australian, and who doesn't want to go on a date 
                with an Australian babe?!</p>
            <p>So we set up the date but had to push it off a couple times. It wasn't a priority, because I was seeing so many random people at that point. And when I finally met Eddy for our first date, I had been going on so many of these, and was so busy, I didn't even know his name. I walked into the restaurant where we met, and I literally had to check my phone, 
                like, Who the fuck is that guy?</p>  
                <h2>Cathy and Stefano</h2>
            <img src="images/love4.jpeg" alt="a picture of cathy and Stefano">
            <p>‘I’d had quite a few dating app disasters but I’m a pretty positive person so I knew there were good men on there, too. The first time I saw my now partner on the Inner Circle app, I thought I recognised him. It was really weird.
                 He has children and lives about an hour away, but my gut told me to look at his profile. He said hello first and asked for my number after two days of exchanging messages.
                 We spoke on the phone on the Thursday and met up on the Saturday. It was all pretty quick but I found I lost interest if a guy took a few days to respond. 
                 The distance and the fact that he has kids means this relationship is different to any other that I’ve had.</p>
